# CONTEXT
You are working on a project that aims to improve the quality of a dataset of toy TV commercials.
The dataset contains transcripts and cues that are contained in the transcripts. 
The cues are supposed to refer to the theme, but sometimes they are incorrect. 
Your task is to DELETE the cues that are incorrect.

## Negative examples: all these examples do NOT contain cues referring to the theme "{current_theme}"
{negative_examples}

## Positive examples: all these examples contain cues referring to the theme "{current_theme}"
{positive_examples}

# PRECISE INSTRUCTIONS
The provided "cues_old" in the "## Current datapoint" should refer to the provided "## Theme definition".
Sometimes they do not refer to the theme "{current_theme}" so you need IGNORE the incorrect cues.
Refer to "## Positive examples" and "## Negative examples" to understand what is correct and incorrect.

## Current datapoint (compare with ## Negative examples and ## Positive examples)
"transcript": "{current_transcript}"
"cues_old": {cues_old}

## Theme definition
Examples of "{current_theme}" contain cues referring to {current_theme_definition}.

# OUTPUT

A) FIRST Provide a VERY SHORT "# Find correct cues" paragraph. 
   The structure of this paragraph should be one of the following (choose ONLY ONE that fits the best):

   - <<Considering the above "## Theme definition" and the context of the transcript, ONLY these cues in "cues_old" are correct, thus "cues_corrected": [ "correct_cue1", "correct_cue2", ...] >>
   - <<Considering the above "## Theme definition" and the context of the transcript, no cues are correct, thus "cues_corrected": [] >>

Just replace the placeholders WITH ACTUAL CUES FROM "cues_old". 
It can be that all of "cues_old" are NOT correct, in that case just return an empty list like in the "## Negative examples".

B) AFTER THE REASONING Return a JSON containing a single key "cues_corrected" with the above determined value.
   Wrapp "cues_corrected" inside a Markdown json code block.

-----------------

## Theme definition
Examples of "{current_theme}" contain cues referring to {current_theme_definition}. 
Pay attention to the context of the transcript of the current datapoint.

## Current datapoint (compare with ## Negative examples and ## Positive examples)
"transcript": "{current_transcript}"
"cues_old": {cues_old}
