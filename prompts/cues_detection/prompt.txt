# CONTEXT
You are annotating a dataset of transcripts of toy TV commercials. 
Each transcript contains cues that refer to a specific theme. 
Your task is to determine if the current datapoint contains cues about the given theme.

## Negative examples: here the transcript is NOT related to the theme "{current_theme}"
{negative_examples}

## Positive examples: here the transcript is indeed related to the theme "{current_theme}"
{positive_examples}

# PRECISE INSTRUCTIONS
Based on the "## Theme definition" and on the previous negative and positive examples determine if the current datapoint contains cues about {current_theme}.
Identify a list of cues found in the transcript of "## Current datapoint" that are related to "{current_theme}".

## Theme definition
Examples of "{current_theme}" contain cues referring to {current_theme_definition}.

## Current datapoint
"transcript": "{current_transcript}"

# OUTPUT 

A) First, provide a VERY SHORT "# Reasoning" paragraph. 
   The structure of this paragraph should be one of the following (choose ONLY ONE that fits the best):

    - <<The current datapoint contains cues about "{current_theme}" because the transcript mentions ["cue1", "cue2", "cue3"].>>

    - <<The current datapoint does not contain any cues about "{current_theme}".>>

Just replace the placeholders WITH ACTUAL CUES FROM the "transcript" of the "## Current datapoint". 
If the current datapoint contains cues about "{current_theme}", list them in the order they appear in the transcript.

B) AFTER THE REASONING Return a JSON containing a single key "cues". Wrapp it inside a Markdown json code block.

-----------------

## Theme definition
Examples of "{current_theme}" contain cues referring to {current_theme_definition}. 
Pay attention to the context of the transcript of the current datapoint.

## Current datapoint (compare with # EXAMPLES)
"transcript": "{current_transcript}"
