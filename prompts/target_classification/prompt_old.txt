# TASKS DESCRIPTION
You are a scholar working on a dataset of toy TV commercials, where each commercial is targeted at a specific audience. 
Your task is to determine the target audience of a given commercial based on its transcript, soundtrack description, and themes.
Each of the provided datapoints contains the "transcript" of the commercial, a "soundtrack_description" that describes the sound and music, and a list of "themes" that are present in the "transcript".
The target audience of each commercial is represented by the key "{classes_key}".

In the following examples the key "{classes_key}" can have {number_of_classes} different values: {classes}.

# EXAMPLES

{examples}

# PRECISE INSTRUCTIONS
Based on the previous examples, determine the value of "{classes_key}" for the "## Current datapoint".

## Current datapoint (!!!Compare with # EXAMPLES!!!)
"transcript": "{current_transcript}"
"soundtrack_description": "{soundtrack_description}"
"themes": {current_themes}

IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS: 
The themes and the transcript often contain gender-based stereotypes associated with the "{classes_key}".
Some themes are more clearly gender-stereotyped than others, pay attention primarily to such themes, but be careful with false positives.
Always check the transcript of "## Current datapoint" to spot the false positive themes that might be misleading.

## Definitions of current themes
{current_themes_definitions}

# OUTPUT

A) First, provide a VERY SHORT "# Reasoning" paragraph. 

The structure of this paragraph should be one of the following (choose the ONE that fits the best):

{reasoning_structure}

The reasoning should be VERY SHORT and concise. Just replace the placeholders with the actual themes from the current datapoint. 

B) AFTER THE REASONING Return a JSON with a single key "{classes_key}" with the above determined value --- choose only ONE from: {classes}.
Wrapp it inside a Markdown json code block.

## Current datapoint (!!!Compare with # EXAMPLES!!!)
"transcript": "{current_transcript}"
"soundtrack_description": "{soundtrack_description}"
"themes": {current_themes}

IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS: 
The themes and the transcript often contain gender-based stereotypes associated with the "{classes_key}".
Some themes are more clearly gender-stereotyped than others, pay attention primarily to such themes, but be careful with false positives.
Always check the transcript of "## Current datapoint" to spot the false positive themes that might be misleading.

## Definitions of current themes
{current_themes_definitions}

{themes_to_classes}

Check for the PRESENCE or the LACK of gender-stereotypes such as "doll", "action figure", "princess", "superhero", etc. in the transcript of the current datapoint.
Base the # Reasoning on the comparison between the transcript, themes and soundtrack of ## Current datapoint and those of the # EXAMPLES.
The "soundtrack_description" can be good indicator of the target audience, but this is not always the case, you must decide on a case-by-case basis.
Finally, the chosen value of "{classes_key}" for the current datapoint can only be ONE of: {classes}.
